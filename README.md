   Statistics: 
   The statistics analysis tab showed the descriptive analysis of the noise data, inlcuding the numbers of noise complaints by time series and locations, and the types of noise compplaints distribution.
   
   Map: 
   This tab is an interactive page which enables the user to choose any location in New York City and the algorism will automatically calculate and output the geographical information, and the noise sources around the point by the radium which also can be altinated by users.
   
   Data: 
   Original datas which we used to conduct the analysis and write the algorisms. It also contains the searching and sorting functions.
	
Hope this app can help New Yorkers to find their peaceful land!
